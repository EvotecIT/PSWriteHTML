  - ☑ **Potentially Breaking Changes**
    - ☑ Removed custom Headings (H1,H2,H3,H4,H5,H6) -> `New-HTMLHeading` still works just using defaults
      - ☑ It was totally inconsistent between H1-H6, probably needs new CSS for those later on that will be consistent and inline with other code
    - ☑ Removed H7 heading totally - it got there by some copy paste from internet
    - ☑ Removed custom Horizontal Line (HR) -> `New-HTMLHorizonalLine` still works just using defaults
      - ☑ Not looking good, the default one looks better, more consitent but may need some work in the future
    - ☑ `New-HTMLLogo` is now marked as obsolete. It was there from day one but it's not really customizable. New way will be given sometime in the future
      - ☑ It still works, CSS code is only added when it's used
    - ☑ Removed custom link highlights CSS. Not sure if it was ever used, hopefully not. May come back in future in better form
    - ☑ When `EmailBody` is used it will no longer put `JavaScript` or `CSS` inside HTML for advanced features such as DataTables, or anything that used to be there
      - ☑ This is to make sure EMAIL HTML is as small as possbile
      - ☑ JavaScript in emails won't work in 90% of cases and it would just add to the junk in HTML
      - ☑ However if EmailBody is used within `Email` and `AttachSelf` is used it will generate same HTML using full JS/CSS code
      - ☑ This ensures that self attach should work as it used to, at the same time providing small HTML in email
    - ☑ JavaScript/CSS is now marked as safe for email or normal HTML reports/pages. What that means some CSS/JS is marked only as being added to Email or vice versa.
  - ☑ **Improvements to CSS**
    - ☑ The goal of PSWriteHTML is to get into state where only really nessecary code is added. Less CSS is now included by default
    - ☑ Hopefully there are no major problems from those changes
    - ☑ The default margin for all elements should be `5px`, however when used within email it will be set to `0px`
      - [ ] This mainly is important for Images/Text/Headings but all other html objects such as tables and so on, also are supposed to have `5px` margin
    - ☑ It would seem `Roboto Condensed` or other fonts defined in font-family across code were never used and defaults were kicking in
      - ☑ I've now fixed it so `Roboto Condensed` is used when `Online` mode
      - ☑ In `Offline` mode it will still go back to `Sans-Serif` (usually `Arial`)
      - ☑ I've removed other `font-families` from multiple CSS files to make it visually consistent
      - [ ] May need to be revisited if `Roboto Condensed` is best choice
    - ☑ Update to `FontsAwesome` from 5.14 to 5.15.1
    - ☑ Update to `FontsAwesome` to work offline
      - ☑ Unfortunetly this means 500KB file size in CSS module size and output HTML file is 500KB bigger
      - ☑ I'm skipping including of TTF/SVG/EOT types as WOFF and WOFF2 should be enough for modern browsers
  - ☑ **Other changes**
    - ☑ Changed Tables `row height` to fit more data
    - ☑ Changed Tables `noscript` version (email + no javascript) to fit more how DataTables looks like
    - ☑ Improved HTMLTable with `Simplify` switch positioning
    - ☑ `New-HTML` added parameter `AddComment` - by default comments are not added to code now
    - ☑ Added `link` preloading for styles - not sure if it will help but why not
    - ☑ Fix for `New-DiagramOptionsLinks` setting lenght which would have resultant html error
    - ☑ `EmailTextBox` renamed to `New-HTMLTextBox`. `EmailTextBox` added as alias to that command
    - ☑ Added `Format` and `Minify` switches to `New-HTML` and `EmailBody`. Those will only be working if [PSParseHTML](https://github.com/EvotecIT/PSParseHTML) is installed.
      - [ ] `PSParseHTML` is not installed by default and you need to install it separatly `Install-Module PSParseHTML`. There is no intention of bundling it at this moment.
      - [ ] **Known issue**: Removes comment required for `Internet Explorer` javascript to not prompt when using as local file
    - ☑ Improved `New-HTMLTimelineItem` generated HTML when no color is used
    - ☑ Added `Enable-HTMLFeature` to bring JS/CSS even if it's not used
    - ☑ `Calendars` & `DataTables` & `Diagrams` should now resize/fit properly on Global Tab change
    - ☑ `Calendars` & `DataTables` & `Diagrams` are now resize/fit properly on Wizard Step Change
    - ☑ `Calendars` & `DataTables` & `Diagrams` are now resize/fit properly on Tab Panel Tab Change
    - ☑ Tracks all `tables` with `Fixed Headers`/`Footers` and `disables`/`enables` them on `tab switch`/`wizard step` switch / `tab panel` switch
  - ☑ **Diagram Changes**
    - ☑ `New-DiagramLink` - added `SmoothType`, `SmoothForceDirection` and `SmoothRoundness`
    - ☑ `New-DiagramLink` - fixed `FontAlign` which was using wrong `validateset`.
    - ☑ `Diagrams` should now fit properly upon changing tabs. It used to hide outside of screen.
  - ☑ **Library updates**
    - ☑ Update of `Apex Charts` to 3.23.0
    - ☑ Update of `VisJS` to 8.5.5

  - ☑ Small update to `New-HTMLList` with `Reversed` parameter
  - ☑ Fix for missing responsive button for `New-HTMLTable`
  - ☑ Updates to offline `DataTables` library
## 0.0.116 - 2020.10.21
  - ☑ Charts improvement for `Flex` usage (doesn't require `Panel` anymore for positioning)
## 0.0.115 - 2020.10.21
  - ☑ Updates to DataStore Javascript
## 0.0.114 - 2020.10.20
  - ☑ Small fix to `New-HTMLTable` with DataStore `JavaScript`
## 0.0.113 - 2020.10.19
  - ☑ `New-HTMLTable` - changes/improvements/adds
    - ☑ Reworked JS/CSS loading for DataTables. It should now load less JS/CSS code by default making HTML smaller and more readable especially if not using all features
      - [ ] Some more work in this area is required. Small breaking change was introduced
    - ☑ **Breaking Change** - Renamed `DisableColumnReorder` to `EnableColumnReorder`
      - [ ] The reason for this is that the functionality is most likely used by very few people if at all
      - [ ] This, in turn, allows me to load JS/CSS for ColumnReordering only when someone requests for this functionality
    - ☑ Added `EnableRowReorder`
    - ☑ Added `EnableKeys` (excel like movement) to `New-HTMLTable`. Probably could add more options for this via nested `New-TableXXX`
    - ☑ Added `PagingLength` to `New-HTMLTable`. This improves `PagingOptions` / `DisablePaging`.
      - If user doesn't set Paging Length it will use defaults
      - If user doesn't set Paging Options it will use default `@(15, 25, 50, 100)`
      - If user doesn't set Paging Length, but sets different Paging Options such as `@(5,10,15)`, initial paging length will be set to lowest value `5`
      - If user sets paging options and sets paging length it will set as requested
    - ☑ Added `EnableScroller` to `New-HTMLTable`. This improves `ScrollY`. It allows to load data as it appears rather than loading everything. Should be plenty useful in JavaScript DataStore for large datasets
    - [ ] Enabling Scroller doesn't require ScrollY enablement, but it will use ScrollSizeY default 500px. You can change it tho.
    - ☑ Added `EnableAutoFill` to `New-HTMLTable`
    - ☑ Improved `New-HTMLTable` to load only required CSS/JS (hopefully nothing will be broken)
    - ☑ Updated `Out-HTMLView` with all new and old parameters to keep it synced with same the features as `New-HTMLTable` - hopefully, I didn't break anything
    - ☑ Updated some `DataTables` JS/CSS versions
    - [ ] `New-HTMLTableOption` allows now to define `BoolAsString`, `NumberAsString` and `DateTimeFormat`
      - [ ] This only works in `JavaScript` and `AjaxJSON` datastore.
      - [ ] This allows one to better control how they want their bools, numbers, and DateTime displayed
      - [ ] For example: `New-HTMLTableOption -DateTimeFormat "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss" -BoolAsString`
      - [ ] It will make sure all dates are converted to their string representation as requested
      - [ ] Default DateTime is `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`
      - [ ] This is possible thanks to `ConvertTo-JsonLiteral` which is my own implementation of `ConvertTo-JSON`
  - ☑ Navigation Functionality (WIP)
    - ☑ Added `New-HTMLNav` command (WIP)
    - ☑ Added `New-HTMLNavLink` command (WIP)

    - ☑ Added `New-HTMLWizard`
    - ☑ Added `New-HTMLWizardStep`

## 0.0.109 - 2020.09.28
  - If no author is provided meta is not added
  - `EmailText` `size` parameter supports the usual settings as described below
  - Removed `EmailText` and added it as an alias to `New-HTMLText` which does the same thing
  - Renamed `EmailHTML` to `Add-HTML`, added `EmailHTML` as alias - this allows to inline any code wherever it's used
  - Added `EmailImage` as alias to `New-HTMLImage`
  - Added `Inline` switch to `New-HTMLImage (EmailImage)` which embeddes given url/file image directly into HTML
  - Improved `New-HTMLImage/EmailImage`
  - Prevents errors `New-HTMLTable` if null is passed as the first element in DataTable (skips processing)

    - ☑ Fix/workaround for IE11 issue with section not showing any data, broken in 0.0.99
## 0.0.99 - 2020.09.07
  - **Notes**
    - ☑ `UTF8` will be set by default for `HTML`. `Email` will pick content encoding from `HTML`
      - ☑ It was already set for `HTML` for `charset` so just making sure it's all the same
    - ☑ Encoding parameter for `EmailOption` and `Email` are DEPRECATED
      - ☑ Whatever you set there doesn't matter - it will always be set to `UTF8`. From my tests setting it to anything else messes up display in some clients
      - ☑ While not really breaking change, just thought I would make sure people are aware
      - ☑ The reason is HTML was always `UTF8` and setting it up on transport level to `Unicode` or other encodings would break things
      - ☑ In outlook it wouldn't matter as it would fix it, but in other clients such as Thunderbird it would go nuts
  - **Library updates**
    - Update to `vis-network` from 8.2.1 to 8.3.2

## 0.0.98 - 2020.08.30
  - **New/Non-Breaking**
    - ☑ Added `DataStoreID` to `New-HTMLTable` for use with `DataStore = JavaScript`
      - ☑ This allows multiple tables to use the same data. Useful if you want to present the same data in different tables across a single HTML file.
    - ☑ Fixes for JavaScript datastore and conditional formatting
## 0.0.97 - 2020.08.29
  - **Breaking changes**

    - ☑ New-DiagramNode
      - [ ] Exposed `ArrowsToEnabled`, `ArrowsMiddleEnabled`, `ArrowsFromEnabled`
    - ☑ Update to Diagram Height accepting multiple size values
      - ☑ This allows for `New-HTMLDiagram -Height 'calc(100vh - 50px)'` which fills whole screen (within section)
      - ☑ Or this `New-HTMLDiagram -Height 'calc(100vh - 50px)' -Width '50vw'` although not that useful, as flex fixes most of it
    - ☑ Updates `New-DiagramOptionsPhysics` - exposed a bunch of new options plus help
    - ☑ Updates `New-DiagramOptionsLayout` - added some help and new options
  - **Updated library**
    - ☑ `Vis-network` to 8.2.1
## 0.0.96 - 2020.08.28
  - ☑ It seems SearchPanes from DataTables conflict with `New-HTMLDiagram`
    - ☑ Separated that library to be added only on demand
## 0.0.95 - 2020.08.27
  - **Notes**
    - I'm reworking CSS model in which PSWriteHTML works allowing for more consistent design and more customization options. This means some breaking changes will happen soon enough.
    - FontSize will be reworked for most commands (as I get to them) to take `[int]` input but also `[string]` input
      - If `[int]` is provided it assumes size given in `px`. If text is provided it takes it as is.
        - If `15` this means `15px`
        - If `15px` this means `15px`
        - If `15pt` this means `15pt`
        - If `'15'` this means `15px` as it will convert to `[int]` first
        - Anything else will be treated as is meaning you know what you are doing
  - **Breaking changes**
    - ☑ Default Font Size for everything is `8pt`. This includes:
      - ☑ Tabs used to have `15px`. Now by default `8pt`. You will need `New-HTMLTabOption -FontSize '15px'` or `New-HTMLTabOption -FontSize 15` to set default fontsize for Tabs to it's old value (along with other customizations if needed)
      - ☑ Inputs for Tables (Filtering) having static `8pt`
  - **Improvements**
    - ☑ `New-HTMLMain` - allows customizing font size, font type, background color, and text color globally - this will overwrite defaults as described above
    - ☑ Fix TempFilePath for `Email` to work correctly on MacOS/Linux - tnx roberttoups [#146](https://github.com/EvotecIT/PSWriteHTML/pull/146)
    - ☑ Auto-wrapping of Tabs is enabled - can be disabled via `New-HTMLTabOption`
    - ☑ Bunch of options to control wrapping/direction of tabs via `New-HTMLTabOption`

    - ☑ Fixed broken `Tab` switching in **Internet Explorer 11**
    - ☑ Added basic support for `SearchPane` within `New-HTMLTable`
    - ☑ Fixed broken `Tables` refresh on `Tabs` when using named `Tables`
    - ☑ Fixed `New-HTMLTable`/`Out-HTMLView` with `-AllProperties` displaying wrong properties for IDictionary objects

    - ☑ Fixed `New-HTMLTable` properly display ordered dictionary, array of strings, array of singular objects, PSCustomObject with 1 column
    - ☑ Fixed `New-HTMLTable` properly displaying column name as `Name` in PowerShell 5.1 when used with int/string
    - ☑ Fixed `New-HTMLText` font size was ignored. Also now supports 15, 15px, 15pt as described in notes.
    - ☑ Resolves peformance issues by adding new parameter `DataStore` for `New-HTMLTable` to use with large tables
  - **Added cmdlets**
    - ☑ `New-HTMLTableStyle`
    - ☑ `New-HTMLTableOption` - added to provide `DataStore` parameter which globally sets required store, may be used for other things in future
    - ☑ `New-ChartTimeLine` - added basic support for TimeLine Charts
  - **Renamed cmdlets** (non-breaking change via aliases)
    - ☑ `New-HTMLTabOption` -> `New-HTMLTabStyle`
    - ☑ `New-HTMLSectionOption` -> `New-HTMLSectionStyle`

      - ☑ Choosing colors should be easier (wildcard added before and after)
      - ☑ Make it optional for `New-HTMLTab` to force TextTransform (uses global)
